After one month of product development, I tried spending one week after launch [my business](https://getmakerlog.com/products/walimah) quietly to work on sales and marketing. Although my self is a tech person but marketing and sales stuffs are not that strage to me. I have built some businesses since I was a freshman in university, so marketing and sales things are quite familiar with me (familiar but not an expert).

> I had 3 businesses (startup) before, all ended up with failure.

> I said earlier before "quietly", so I didn't launch it in public like on Twitter, IG, or Linkedin.
