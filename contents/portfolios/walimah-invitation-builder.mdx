WalimahApp is a no code web invitation builder. Making it easy for non technical person to build his own wedding website.

## Problems

There were some problems that we had to solve while building this project.
-   **Building customizable components**
-   **Building a customizable database**
-   **Data caching**

## Solutions

#### 1. Building customizable components and database

The consideration between no-code at all vs. flexible low code was very tough. We had to make sure that the user can build the entire website without any code. That's why we had to build a customizable database and components. The problems came when there were more component variations and we had to build a component for each variation. This would make the website not really have a customizable style, as the style would be fixed to some variants.

Another solution is by using flexible low-code, where at some points the user will require knowing some basic HTML/CSS code to add the styling, but the problems didn't stop here. This would make the UX less attractive.

#### 2. Caching

Caching and data invalidation were pretty tough as well. We were extensively fetching and updating the data in real-time where anything updated from the UI was sent to the server. This was a problem because we had to make sure that the data was not being fetched multiple times.

The cache will only happen within the client side, but not on the panel builder side.
